# HOAX

A MVC style minimalistic code structure for serving REST API using GoLang.

## Goals

The main goal behind this repo is to make something simple by which I (or anyone) can just download/fork this and able to make zer first API call instantly what we have seen in other famous frameworks like Laravel, Django, ROR.

Primarily it is planned to include basic logger, middleware, API Throttle, Route and controller structure.

This doc will be updated as soon as the more module is included in this structure.
